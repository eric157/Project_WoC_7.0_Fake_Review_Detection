## 📝 Overview
This pipeline preprocesses a dataset of reviews and prepares it for analysis or modeling. Key features include:
- Text preprocessing (e.g., contraction expansion, tokenization, lemmatization).
- Feature extraction via TF-IDF vectorization.
- Modularized components for maintainability and scalability.

---

## ✨ Features
- **Clean and Normalize Text**: Includes expansion of contractions, removal of punctuation and digits, tokenization, and lemmatization.
- **TF-IDF Feature Extraction**: Converts text into numerical features using unigrams and bigrams.
- **Scalable Design**: Modular architecture to extend and customize the pipeline for different use cases.

## ⚙️ Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/fake-review-detection.git
   cd fake-review-detection
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure Python 3.8+ is installed, then install required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Install NLTK Dependencies**:
   The script handles NLTK downloads automatically, but you can also install them manually:
   ```python
   import nltk
   nltk.download('punkt')
   nltk.download('wordnet')
   nltk.download('stopwords')
   nltk.download('omw-1.4')
   ```

---

## 🚀 Usage

1. **Prepare the Input Dataset**:
   - Place your dataset in the `data/` folder.
   - Ensure the file is a CSV with a text column named `text_` (or update `TEXT_COLUMN` in `main.py`).

2. **Run the Pipeline**:
   Execute the pipeline by running:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Output**:
   The processed dataset will be saved in the `output/` folder as `FakeReviewDataPreprocessed.csv`.

## 📦 Modules

### **1. Preprocessing (`preprocessing.py`)**
Handles text cleaning and normalization:
- Expands contractions (e.g., "can't" → "cannot").
- Converts text to lowercase.
- Removes punctuation and digits.
- Tokenizes, removes stopwords, and applies lemmatization.

### **2. Vectorization (`vectorization.py`)**
Extracts features from preprocessed text:
- Uses TF-IDF vectorization to convert text into numerical data.
- Configurable parameters include:
  - Maximum features (`max_features`).
  - N-gram range (`ngram_range`).
  - Frequency thresholds (`max_df`, `min_df`).

### **3. Main Script (`main.py`)**
Orchestrates the workflow:
- Loads the dataset.
- Applies preprocessing and vectorization.
- Saves the final dataset to the output folder.

---

## 🛠️ Future Enhancements
- Add support for advanced vectorization techniques (e.g., Word2Vec, BERT).
- Enable custom stopword lists.
- Integrate end-to-end machine learning models for review classification.
- Implement detailed logging and error tracking.
