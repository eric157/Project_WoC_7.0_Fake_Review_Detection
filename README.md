## 📦 Checkpoints Overview

### Checkpoint 1: Preprocessing & Feature Extraction
- Loads raw review data, cleans text through advanced preprocessing techniques, and converts it into numerical vectors using TF-IDF.
- Outputs are saved for subsequent model training.

### Checkpoint 2: Model Training & Evaluation
- Trains a Logistic Regression model with Bayesian hyperparameter tuning.
- Evaluates the model using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, saving the best-performing model.

### Checkpoint 3: Web Scraping
- Automates the extraction of Amazon reviews with Selenium & BeautifulSoup.
- Handles dynamic content via headless browsing and cookie-based login.
- Stores scraped reviews in CSV format.

### Checkpoint 4: Web App & Prediction
- Provides a Flask API for real-time review analysis.
- Features an intuitive, dark-themed UI with interactive metric boxes to display predictions.
