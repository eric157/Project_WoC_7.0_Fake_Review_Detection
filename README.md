## üìù Overview

This pipeline preprocesses a dataset of reviews and prepares it for analysis or modeling. Key features include:

- Text preprocessing (e.g., contraction expansion, tokenization, lemmatization).
- Feature extraction via TF-IDF vectorization.
- Modularized components for maintainability and scalability.

---

## ‚ú® Features

- **Clean and Normalize Text**: Includes expansion of contractions, removal of punctuation and digits, tokenization, and lemmatization.
- **TF-IDF Feature Extraction**: Converts text into numerical features using unigrams and bigrams.
- **Scalable Design**: Modular architecture to extend and customize the pipeline for different use cases.

    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ preprocessing.py       # Functions for text preprocessing (cleaning, lemmatization, etc.)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ vectorization.py       # TF-IDF vectorization logic for feature extraction
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.py                # Main script to run the entire pipeline
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ data/                  # Folder to store input datasets (e.g., CSV files with reviews)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ output/                # Folder to store the processed datasets and results
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md              # Project documentation (this file)
```

## üöÄ Usage

1. **Prepare the Input Dataset**:
   - Place your dataset in the `data/` folder.
   - Ensure the file is a CSV with a text column named `text` (or update `TEXT_COLUMN` in `main.py`).

2. **Run the Pipeline**:
   Execute the pipeline by running:

   ```bash
   python checkpoint_1/main.py
   ```

3. **Output**:
   The processed dataset will be saved in the `output/` folder as `FakeReviewDataPreprocessed.csv`.

## üì¶ Modules

### **1. Preprocessing (`preprocessing.py`)**

Handles text cleaning and normalization:

- Expands contractions (e.g., "can't" ‚Üí "cannot").
- Converts text to lowercase.
- Removes punctuation and digits.
- Tokenizes, removes stopwords, and applies lemmatization.

### **2. Vectorization (`vectorization.py`)**

Extracts features from preprocessed text:

- Uses TF-IDF vectorization to convert text into numerical data.
- Configurable parameters include:
  - Maximum features (`max_features`).
  - N-gram range (`ngram_range`).
  - Frequency thresholds (`max_df`, `min_df`).

### **3. Main Script (`main.py`)**

Orchestrates the workflow:

- Loads the dataset.
- Applies preprocessing and vectorization.
- Saves the final dataset to the output folder.

## üõ†Ô∏è Future Enhancements

As the Fake Review Detection project evolves, the following enhancements are planned to improve the system‚Äôs performance and capabilities:

1. **Support for Advanced Vectorization Techniques**:
   - Implement more sophisticated text representations such as **Word2Vec** and **BERT** to capture deeper semantic meanings and improve model accuracy.
2. **Custom Stopword Lists**:
   - Allow users to integrate and define their own stopword lists to better suit specific datasets or industries (e.g., e-commerce reviews, product-specific jargon).
3. **Integration of End-to-End Machine Learning Models**:
   - Develop and integrate machine learning models that can not only detect fake reviews but also classify the reviews as **critical** or **non-critical**, using models like:
     - **Random Forest Classifier**
     - **Support Vector Classifier (SVC)**
     - **Logistic Regression**
4. **Model Deployment and Web Scraping Enhancements**:
   - Further enhance the **web scraping** capabilities to handle dynamic content and more e-commerce platforms, expanding the project‚Äôs reach.
   - Continue to fine-tune model performance with cross-validation and feature engineering.

5. **Error Logging and Detailed Tracking**:
   - Implement comprehensive **logging** and **error tracking** systems to ensure that the pipeline can be debugged easily in case of issues, and monitor progress through tools like **Flask** for deployed models.

6. **User Interface Improvements**:
   - Build a more interactive **frontend** to allow users to submit product URLs directly and view the classification results in a user-friendly manner.

7. **Model Performance Monitoring**:
   - Incorporate performance metrics and feedback loops that allow the system to automatically retrain and adjust models based on incoming new review data.
