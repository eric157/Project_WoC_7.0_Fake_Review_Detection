## 📝 Overview

This pipeline is designed to process raw datasets of reviews through several stages: preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation. The project is modularly divided into two checkpoints:

### Checkpoint 1:
Focuses on text cleaning, preprocessing, and vectorization into numerical features.

### Checkpoint 2:
Trains multiple machine learning models, evaluates them, and identifies the best-performing model for detecting fake reviews.

## ✨ Features

- **Text Preprocessing**:
  - Expands contractions (e.g., "can't" → "cannot").
  - Removes punctuation, digits, and stopwords.
  - Converts text to lowercase and applies lemmatization.

- **TF-IDF Vectorization**:
  - Converts text into numerical features using Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency.
  - Configurable for n-grams, feature limits, and frequency thresholds.

- **Model Training**:
  - Supports Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Feedforward Neural Networks, and SVMs.

- **Evaluation Metrics**:
  - Reports performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

- **Model Persistence**:
  - Saves trained models for future use.

- **Best Model Selection**:
  - Identifies the best model based on the validation F1-score.

- **Modular Design**:
  - Enables maintainability, scalability, and customization.

## 🚀 Usage

### Checkpoint 1

1. **Prepare the Input Dataset**:
   - Place your dataset in the `checkpoint_1/data/` folder.
   - Ensure the file is a CSV with a text column named `text` (or update `TEXT_COLUMN` in `main.py`).

2. **Run the Preprocessing Pipeline**:
   - Execute the pipeline by running:
   
   ```bash
   python checkpoint_1/main.py
   ```
   - Output: The processed dataset will be saved in `checkpoint_1/output/` as `FakeReviewDataPreprocessed.csv`.

### Checkpoint 2

1. **Ensure Checkpoint 1 is Completed**:
   - Verify that `FakeReviewDataPreprocessed.csv` exists in the `checkpoint_1/output/` folder.

2. **Run the Training and Evaluation Pipeline**:
   - Execute the pipeline by running:
   
   ```bash
   python checkpoint_2/main.py
   ```
   - Output:
     - Trained models will be saved in `checkpoint_2/models/`.
     - Evaluation metrics will be saved in `checkpoint_2/output/` as `model_evaluation_metrics.txt`.

## 📦 Modules

### Checkpoint 1 Modules

1. **Preprocessing (`preprocessing.py`)**:
   - Handles text cleaning and normalization:
     - Expands contractions (e.g., "can't" → "cannot").
     - Converts text to lowercase.
     - Removes punctuation, digits, and stopwords.
     - Applies tokenization and lemmatization.

2. **Vectorization (`vectorization.py`)**:
   - Extracts numerical features from preprocessed text using TF-IDF:
     - Configurable parameters include:
       - Maximum features (`max_features`).
       - N-gram range (`ngram_range`).
       - Frequency thresholds (`max_df`, `min_df`).

3. **Main Script (`main.py`)**:
   - Orchestrates Checkpoint 1:
     - Loads the dataset.
     - Applies preprocessing and vectorization.
     - Saves the processed dataset to the output folder.

### Checkpoint 2 Modules
