"This watch is an exceptional value with several premium features.Screen: the screen is vibrant and dynamic. The colors are bright and everything is readable in full daylight. The screen sensitivity is fantastic even with a screen protector applied.Connecting this to the TOZO Wear app was simple and easy. Once I download the app, it walked me through the setup and I was ready to use the watch in under 5 Minutes.Once connected I began receiving notifications from my apps immediately and was able to take calls directly on the watch. While I prefer taking calls directly on my phone, the call over the watch is completely functional and has come in handy a couple of times when I was running.The health tracking, heart rate monitor, and O2 sensor are fantastic. I've used name brand watches in the past and these premium functions are nice to have on board.Lastly I am most impressed with the battery life. I get a full 7 days out of this every week. Even if I use all of the functions, I still only have to charge it once a week.Cons: I wish there were some more watch screens so I could customize more. I also suggest you get a screen protector as the screen can scratch if not protected.

"The Tozo S6 is an impressive smartwatch that blends style with functionality. After using it for some time, I've found it to excel in several areas.Design and AestheticsOne of the standout features of the Tozo S6 is its sleek and elegant design. It‚Äôs a visually appealing accessory that complements both casual and sporty outfits. Whether you're at the gym or a casual outing, this watch looks great on your wrist.Performance at the GymI tested the Tozo S6 extensively during my gym sessions, and it truly shines in this environment. Its tracking capabilities are surprisingly accurate, matching the readings from gym machines with impressive precision. This reliability makes it an excellent choice for fitness enthusiasts who want to keep track of their workouts without second-guessing the data.Other FeaturesWhile my primary focus was on its aesthetic appeal and gym performance, the Tozo S6 also offers a range of features typical of modern smartwatches, such as heart rate monitoring, sleep tracking, and notifications. However, its performance in the gym is where it truly stands out.Final ThoughtsThe Tozo S6 is a fantastic smartwatch for those who value a combination of style and functionality. Its accuracy during workouts and its beautiful design make it a worthy contender in its price range. Whether you're hitting the gym or simply looking for a stylish everyday smartwatch, the Tozo S6 is a great choice.

"This watch has a lot going for it. it nails the basics. You can read your messages, track your sleep, and keep an eye on your heart rate‚Äîall the stuff that actually matters in a sports watch.It feels sturdy and well-made, not cheap at all. The weight is just right‚Äîsimilar to an Apple Watch but a bit lighter‚Äîso it‚Äôs comfortable to wear all day. And the battery life? Seriously impressive. The battery lasts almost a week (5-6 days)Style-wise, it‚Äôs simple but sharp. It‚Äôs affordable, looks great, and is perfect if you want to step up your watch game without breaking the bank. Personally, I‚Äôm more into round faces with leather straps, but this one has a cool, ‚Äúblue-collar flashy‚Äù vibe that I can‚Äôt help but love. Definitely worth checking out!I will come back and post a part 2. But so far tozo products are really affordable and best bang for buck.

"I was impressed with the quality level of this very affordable sports rated smart watch.  I had been looking for an option to use out jogging that I didn't need to worry about getting wet from weather or sweat.  This model is IP68, waterproof, and so far it hasn't been negatively affected by any wet environment usage.  Beyond this, I like how clear the display is for ease of reading notifications, and all my needed activity tracking apps are present.  The watch keeps a charge a good while, and it has kept continuous connectivity.  I really like how sleek and premium the watch looks for the cost; it's a great gift choice for teens and adults with fitness interests.

"I wear it all the time, good for day and night. Works very nicely for keeping track of workouts (moderate weight lifting and indoor cycling for me), tracks my sleep fairly accurately, and allows me to take incoming phone calls hands free even if my phone happens to be in another room. All this and the battery lasts; I charge it once a week and it always has some battery left. Only one negative: you can see in the accompanying photo that I've replaced the black silicone strap that comes with the watch with another 22mm strap that I happened to have because I could not put the provided band on the watch. The silicone material was just too thick to fit into the groove of the watch body.  Bright, easy to read display too.

"I recently picked up this smart watch, and it‚Äôs been pretty handy for everyday use. The screen is bright and clear, which makes checking the time or notifications easy. I also like how I can customize the watch face to match my mood. It has lots of fitness features like heart rate and sleep tracking, and while I‚Äôm not super into workouts, the step counter and other tools are fun to use. I‚Äôve even tried a few of the 100+ sports modes‚Äîit‚Äôs nice to have the option. Answering calls and seeing messages directly on the watch is a convenient feature, especially when I don‚Äôt want to pull out my phone. It‚Äôs also waterproof, so I don‚Äôt worry about it getting wet.  Overall, it‚Äôs a nice watch for the price, especially if you‚Äôre looking for something functional and easy to use.

"This is by far the coolest smartwatch I have ever owned!I have owned Apple Watches, Google Watches, and Samsung Watches...And while they are all nice, they are also terribly expensive.This one is dirt cheap and packed full of features. The watch is beautiful (it looks like an Apple Watch) and feels premium in the hand.It connects flawlessly to my phone and works well with notifications and calls come through crystal clear. It works with both iOS and Android flawlelessly. The display is so beautiful and the colors are so rich.My only gripe and the reason I deducted a star...the band. The band is the weakest link of this watch. It feels cheap and it doesn't feel strong. It feels odd around my wrist and not comfortable at all. It was also a pain to connect to the actual watch, took me about 6 tries...In general, this is an amazing watch, and it is worth the money. It gives you some premium features (heart monitoring, oxygen monitoring, sleep tracking, etc) while looking and feeling premium. It looks like a high end Apple Watch for cheap!

The weight is just right—similar to an Apple Watch but a bit lighter—so it’s comfortable to wear all day. And the battery life? Seriously impressive. The battery lasts almost a week (5-6 days)Style-wise, it’s simple but sharp. It’s affordable, looks great, and is perfect if you want to step up your watch game without breaking the bank. Personally, I’m more into round faces with leather straps, but this one has a cool, “blue-collar flashy” vibe that I can’t help but love. Definitely worth checking out!I will come back and post a part 2. But so far tozo products are really affordable and best bang for buck.

"Ich habe sofort eine Haut Irritation vom Armband bekommen. Wer weis was da alles drin ist. Die Uhr ist so nicht schlecht.Koppelt sich ständig vom Telefon ab. Ohne Verbindung. Die Benachrichtigungen der Apps funktionieren auch nicht. Mache Benachrichtigungen kommen und mache nicht.Die App ist sehr Einfach und Billig aufgemacht. Mit dem Verkäufer kann man nicht verhandeln,sehr schlechter Service und Kommunikation. Kann ich so nicht empfehlen

"Una de las cosas que me gusta de este reloj es el diseño, el incorporar la ruedecita para poder cambiar la pantalla es un acierto. Y desde la app puedes escoger más watch faces. La pantalla se ve nitida y tiene muchas opciones para seguir el ejercicio, monitorizar el sueño, frecuencia cardiaca, etc. La opcion de llamadas no la he usado.

"This watch is an exceptional value with several premium features.Screen: the screen is vibrant and dynamic. The colors are bright and everything is readable in full daylight. The screen sensitivity is fantastic even with a screen protector applied.Connecting this to the TOZO Wear app was simple and easy. Once I download the app, it walked me through the setup and I was ready to use the watch in under 5 Minutes.Once connected I began receiving notifications from my apps immediately and was able to take calls directly on the watch. While I prefer taking calls directly on my phone, the call over the watch is completely functional and has come in handy a couple of times when I was running.The health tracking, heart rate monitor, and O2 sensor are fantastic. I've used name brand watches in the past and these premium functions are nice to have on board.Lastly I am most impressed with the battery life. I get a full 7 days out of this every week. Even if I use all of the functions, I still only have to charge it once a week.Cons: I wish there were some more watch screens so I could customize more. I also suggest you get a screen protector as the screen can scratch if not protected.

"I was impressed with the quality level of this very affordable sports rated smart watch.  I had been looking for an option to use out jogging that I didn't need to worry about getting wet from weather or sweat.  This model is IP68, waterproof, and so far it hasn't been negatively affected by any wet environment usage.  Beyond this, I like how clear the display is for ease of reading notifications, and all my needed activity tracking apps are present.  The watch keeps a charge a good while, and it has kept continuous connectivity.  I really like how sleek and premium the watch looks for the cost; it's a great gift choice for teens and adults with fitness interests.

"I wear it all the time, good for day and night. Works very nicely for keeping track of workouts (moderate weight lifting and indoor cycling for me), tracks my sleep fairly accurately, and allows me to take incoming phone calls hands free even if my phone happens to be in another room. All this and the battery lasts; I charge it once a week and it always has some battery left. Only one negative: you can see in the accompanying photo that I've replaced the black silicone strap that comes with the watch with another 22mm strap that I happened to have because I could not put the provided band on the watch. The silicone material was just too thick to fit into the groove of the watch body.  Bright, easy to read display too.

"I recently picked up this smart watch, and it‚Äôs been pretty handy for everyday use. The screen is bright and clear, which makes checking the time or notifications easy. I also like how I can customize the watch face to match my mood. It has lots of fitness features like heart rate and sleep tracking, and while I‚Äôm not super into workouts, the step counter and other tools are fun to use. I‚Äôve even tried a few of the 100+ sports modes‚Äîit‚Äôs nice to have the option. Answering calls and seeing messages directly on the watch is a convenient feature, especially when I don‚Äôt want to pull out my phone. It‚Äôs also waterproof, so I don‚Äôt worry about it getting wet.  Overall, it‚Äôs a nice watch for the price, especially if you‚Äôre looking for something functional and easy to use.
