The Intel Core i7-13620H processor and NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4050 GPU deliver exceptional performance, handling even the most demanding games and applications with ease. I’ve been running AAA titles at high settings, and the 144Hz FHD IPS display ensures buttery-smooth visuals with stunning clarity and vibrant colors.The 16GB DDR5 RAM and 512GB Gen 4 SSD provide a perfect balance of speed and storage.

Whether you’re a casual gamer or a serious enthusiast, the Acer Nitro V is a fantastic choice. I couldn’t be happier with my purchase and highly recommend it to anyone looking for top-tier performance without breaking the bank!",5.0
Found this model on sale for cyber moday and needed a new laptop. Never had a gamer laptop but wanted a faster laptop. My old laptop was a much reliable gateway (that should tell you the age) that I used up to the day it died in October. I did get the 32 go ddr5 ram and took out the 16 as soon as I recieved it. I did have to get a webcam and a blu ray drive as I do still use it. The speed is really fast as I did a few updates that were zooming and a download that was lightning. Windows 11 takes some getting use to but impressive computer thus far. It may not be Alienware but it is cheaper. It does get warm but I had a Toshiba that use to get very hot and this is just warm. Quick startup and clear video. It weighs as much as a laptop that should have all the drives and such but that's fine. I don't game as much as I data transfer  and I love the quickness this has. I hihlghly recommend for the price of a entry level game laptop.,5.0
"Laptop worked as expected, running very well for the price. Able to play all games I have tried to (marvel rivals, rocket league, street fighter) and not had any issues! I do use low graphics quality for games like marvel rivals but I don’t feel it has taken away from my experience. Still long great too! I have really only used it while plugged in so cannot attest to the battery life but it has not had huge heat problems while I have been using it. Able to play for 6 straight hours and no heat problems! The fan does get quite loud at points though. Very light-weight so great for moving around from place to place. Do wish it had more storage but other than that I have loved it so far!",4.0
"I bought this computer because its a gaming laptop and has a decent graphics card. This computer will crash while playing games that are 15 years old. I've looked online and this is a pretty common issue. It seems that sending it back to customer support fixes the problem, but that just means they're knowingly making crap computers just to fix them later. DO NOT BUY THIS if you don't want to immediately send it back to be replaced.Otherwise as an email and youtube machine it works great, fast boot, the bios could be more extensive.",1.0
"I build Desktops about one every five years, but this time I went with a laptop for my backup PC.  Wife uses it and games aren't big with her but she has the power to play.  Again, needed only a backup mobile PC in case the main one fails.This laptop has a small .5 SSD but adding more disk space is a future thing.  The dual 8gb x2 is perfect.  It is quiet but no demanding games played to see if the fans are loud.  So far no negatives to report.  Looks great and doesn't take up much space.  I set up a docking port so it powers a monitor, uses wireless mouse and keyboard. (Acer USB C Hub 5 in 1 with 4K HDMI) The laptop lid can be shut now and monitor is on. (check youtube on how to do.)The internet connects better to this machine than my old equipment.  WiFi 6!  The i7 CPU is a plus, though the i5 for $100 less was tempting. Pleasantly surprised and can recommend this product.",5.0
I got the 16GB / 512GB version and it performs well to play newest games on medium graphics. I have added a secondary 4TB SSD and 32 GB ram and it performs even better than another expensive laptops. It can be a little bit noisy and battery can drain fast but that is something expected from a gaming laptop.,5.0
I9 processor 16GB ram 512GB gen4 NVME SSD. I got this over Black Friday sale. I upgraded to 2TB SSD and 32GB ram. Put a 1TB SSD in the second slot and use Macrium Reflect to automatically backup to 2nd drive. Using with Topaz Labs Video AI to enhance movies. Works great. Love the 4060 8GB GPU for movie conversion. Spend the extra and go for 32GB ram and a larger SSD. Well worth the money spent.,5.0
"Good value for the power that you are getting. Also for the size, this is light enough where you can travel around for work and game with this.  I would like to point out I paid the black Friday price for it in NOV 2024. My last Acer brand laptop lasted me about seven years and still going. Mainly got a new one because of the upcoming Trump tariff.For the downsides, the built in speakers does not sound good. However I would say the display quality itself is fairly decent. Other downside of this product is that the keyboard layout is kind of hard to properly type.",4.0
"La laptop no me decepcionó, es tal como la esperaba. Sin embargo hay unas observaciones.-La batería dura muy poco, aún utilizando los gráficos integrados y bajando la tasa de refresco a 60hz. No es ideal para trabajar con programas de ofimatica.-En cuanto al diseño muy bien pero se ensucia mucho-En rendimiento de juegos está excelente. Sin embargo los 16 de ram pueden llegar a quedarse cortos.-Es aconsejable aumentar el espacio en el disco.-No sé qué tan normal sea, pero los ventiladores suenan bastante fuertes.NOTA: Le pongo 4 estrellas por que me esperaba que tuviera la mayoría de estos detalles.",4.0
"This thing is excellent for video editing with resolve and for gaming. Finalizing video went from 45 minutes to 3 on average and I haven't found a game yet it doesn't chew through at full speed cranked all the way up. Only 2 complaints I have are it doesn't come with nearly enough memory, and the fans get super loud even on an air cooled stand. Better than burning it up though I suppose. The framerate on the monitor is great however it's still just a 1080p monitor. I feel for the price they could have put a better resolution screen on it. All in all it's been a champ though.",4.0
"It's very slick, very fast. There's one concern I have: when I'm playing a game, the fan(s) get really loud. I'm wondering how well these are going to hold up, because I've had one laptop with cooling issues before. But I'm new to playing games online, so we'll see!",4.0
"The Acer Nitro V Gaming Laptop packs a punch with its Intel Core i7-13620H and RTX 4050, handling games and multitasking effortlessly. The display is sharp, and cooling is solid, but the battery life is short for on-the-go use. It also gets a bit noisy in performance mode when plugged in.Overall, a great choice for home gaming, but less ideal for portability.",4.0
"Performance seems to be about as good as you could hope for from a ""value-buy"" Gaming laptop. Weight is manageable, if a little on the heavier side, and the build quality is decisively solid. I am able to play the recently released Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 at high near optimal settings, but there is not enough V-Ram to use the Ultra-High Resolution textures (as indicated by the game itself when trying to switch the settings up from the default detected by the game at ""only"" High).The overall experience is exceptionally smooth and after an hour of play the internal CPU temperature and GPU temperatures were stable at 70c. I tested both sitting on a flat, plain desktop and elevated on a tilted-mesh platform for an hour each and was very pleased to see this result.The only reason I can't give 5 full stars for this device is the cooling fans are absurdly loud, easily above 60dB. Please consider your use cases and intentions for this device as you will not be able to quietly play on the couch along others without disturbing their experience. Over-ear headphones and privacy recommended during use.I have not tried any modifications yet, but there should be room for higher RAM should you elect to purchase separate cards to install with two DDR5 slots available. Ease of access to these slots and the NVMe slot appears to be normal for such a device, will need plastic spudgers to release lower covering without damaging the frame.Base-model on offer from Acer site only has 8gbs installed and an i5 processer by default. This version from Amazon was on sale, for the same price as the Acer site's 8gb/i5 version, when purchased but with 16gbs and an i7.",4.0
No camera settings I can find so no teams meetingsHave to restart all the time because it rejects my 4 digit pinNo option to have no password or keyBattery is a disappointmentAll this for a $1200 laptop,4.0
"It is nice laptop. It meets my requirements. The Cooling system is working well, all the USB ports works well. I am so satisfied with this one.",5.0
I was so ready to love this. I’ve had it less than 24 hours and it’s shut off on me 3 times. All I’ve done is install one game no mods or custom content and less than 10 mins of play before screen blacks out. It’s not overheating- I’m hoping I didn’t get a defective device I’m super let down considering the price.,4.0
"I got the i7 13th Gen, 16GB DDR5 RAM, 512GB SSD, I am able to have 5 or more full games at once which is plenty, and I may use my 4TB external if needed, battery doesn't last long, but completely does all I need it to do. I work full time, and I use my laptop for homework,  meetings, email, charts, and entertainment,  gaming,  doesn't skip a beat. I found mine for $750 on black Friday. I would have gotten the i9 version, but couldn't justify the $999 for that. Won't need to upgrade for a few years. Works well for Studio Audio production as well. Absolutely satisfied.",5.0
I enjoy that as a semi-savvy tech person that this laptop gave me a lot of functionality and power without being complicated. It was very nice to retire my desktop for this.,5.0

I have had this for almost 3 years now and must say that I am very satisfied with it. It plays games fast and handles Blender Cycles rendering pretty well. Battery life is great. The sound quality from the built in speakers are pretty good to. Highly Recommended!,5.0

"I bought this laptop just for the VR portion. All for a Meta Quest 3 to play Steam games through. Thought I did my research pretty well. EHHHH!!!!!!WRONG!! DON'T TRUST THE DESCRIPTIONS. VERY MISLEADING. DOES NOT DO WHAT IT SAYS. VERY LOUD AS WELL. & IM TALKING LOUD. SO LOUD ITS HARD TO HEAR WHATS BEING SAID ON THE QUEST. I've spent over 2,000 $ trying to play games on Steam PCVR. I wouldn't suggest this Laptop. It's supposed to be the i7....PROOOBBBAAABBBLLLYYY NOOOT!!Good luck with that. I'm not going to go into a massive rant of nerd explanation. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY !!! IF I CAN SAVE 1 PERSON FROM SPENDING THIS MUCH MONEY ON GARBAGE, ITS WORTH IT!!",3.0
"Works very well and is definitely affordable. The fan while gaming is quite loud, but that's really the only con. It's managable with headphones and a cooling bad.",5.0
This has worked flawlessly and is a good solid laptop for the price.,5.0
I’m not sure yet as we are still figuring it outBut it runs slowFor the money I put out ?I’ll be back to make a second review not sure if it’s because of the Internet it self or the quality of the laptop!My grandson loves that he has a gaming computer and it was easy to set up but I feel it’s running slower then normal! Not freezing,3.0
Exactly what the hubby wanted. Works great and is fast,5.0
"I thought I was going to have to spend more to find a laptop that performs this well. Everything loads fast and runs smoothly. The display is beautiful. The battery life is adequate. The speakers aren't great, but that doesn't matter if you're using headphones. This is not the best laptop to carry around with you as it's pretty heavy, but that helps to give it a feeling of durability and high quality. My previous Acer laptop lasted me almost 10 years and I have every reason to believe I will be using this one for a long time.",5.0
"It can run basic games fine, turn the graphics down on higher processing requirement games like CoD. I run Dota2, Simulators, DDO good-great. The shell could be better, I have had it for 6 months now and already I have wear on the right side next to the touchpad from running my mouse in the area, as well come white is rubbing into black on my arrow keys. I usually run a laptop 2-3 years, and would have this type of wear after a year not 6 months.",4.0
"Absolutely love this computer, it is a great bang for buck product, I’ve been using it every day and so far I still love it, wish it had more customizable fan controls, but other than that no issues at all.",5.0
This machine is perfect for the person that needs power for certain tasks along with a decent battery life.  Using it for daily internet activity as well as weekly streaming of church services.  Performs well and has plenty of power.,5.0

"Sinceramente, no esperaba que funcione tan bien. Es un gusto.Es liviana pero robusta. Gran inversión para editar mis videos y poder trabajar de forma remota.",5.0
I love everything about this gaming laptop except it sometimes randomly shuts off… it performs good enough to play fps games and has a lot of storage for keeping many games! The graphics are strong and can handle any game I play so far quickly. It was easy to setup but I recommend in order to improve the laptop’s temperature to increase the fan speed on the laptops settings.,4.0
"Overall great graphics, runs pretty well, and the screen is amazing. Now the cons would have to be the bios and volume for the headphones, for some odd reason after getting this laptop, I have been experiencing multiple software issues such as the bios refusing to see my other ssd and bluescreening. Requiring my friend and me to go through the bios and disable vmd/vms for it to detect the ssd. Furthermore, the software on this laptop interferes with my headphones' mic causing me to sound like I'm speaking through a cup and after many attempts, I have not found the cause for this. I also know it is not my headphones as it worked on my other laptop the day before using the new one.In total as long you are wary of the bios/software it is worth the money but since the new Nvidia GPUS was released, wait for a price drop as I bought it for like $917 and then two days later the price dropped down to $769.",2.0
"This laptop excelled my expectations in terms of performance. Keyboard feels and looks as standard as any other. Durability seems fine, I don't wanna test that out though 😅 as far as sound, the built in speakers are decent, the fans can get loud but they're controllable of course, so I have a setting for when I'm in school that keeps it nice and quiet.",5.0
"El equipo es totalmente funcional, pero fallan en la presentación el artículo llegó en una caja genérica.",4.0
"After having two failed HP Omens, with HP unable to even fix them, I’ve switched to ACER. So far, it’s faster than the omen by far. When you boot it up, it starts instantly with no delays. So far it’s held up to anything I’ve tested it with, as far as video card goes. The volume is okay, nothing to write home about. I guess it’s okay on price, considering how much the rest of them are. The screen size is nice, but I haven’t tested out the battery too much since all of these laptops tend to have battery issues and you can no longer replace them.",4.0
My son loves this computer. Works great and easy setup!,5.0
For the price point I was not expecting such a great computer but it has ran like a champ. I have had no issues running AAA games with this laptop. I would recommend expanding the storage eventually and this is very easy with this laptop.,5.0
So far so good. Maybe later I'll mention some things.,5.0
"I purchased this as a high school graduation gift for my grandson and he is now using it as he starts his college education.  From his report to me, he is extremely happy with it and he easily carries it from class to class in his backpack.  My other grandson, who has good computer knowledge, picked this specific one out for me because he said it had everything  needed for school, and even games.  I don't know the difference, but trusted he did, and everyone seems happy.",5.0
"Was looking for a laptop that could smoothly run intense Minecraft mods and that's exactly what this laptop did!Was recommended this laptop from a friend and I'm glad I purchased it as I haven't had any issues.

A fantastic investment for gamers and creators alike!",5.0

"Laptop para juego ocaionales triple AAA, los fan un poco ruidoso cuando le exige a la maquina pero lo normal",5.0
"2 stars because it’s fast, has crisp graphics, and the screen is large…BUT it crashes in the middle of playing games. Just in the middle of everything it cuts straight to black screen and you have to hard reboot it to get it back, losing all your progress made. I monitored the heating and cooling and CPU/GPU never got above 71°C (it’s supposed to shut off at 95° for safety) so overheating wasn’t the issue. It wasn’t consistent and there didn’t seem to be any rhyme or reason to the crashing. One day it would work for hours without crashing and the next it would crash every hour on the hour. Factory reset it twice, confirmed all drivers were updated, windows was updated…nothing fixed it. Returning it.Note: This laptop sounds like a jet engine powering up.",2.0
Update: I have had the computer a few months now and have not encountered any further issues. I am pleased with my purchase.I have spent 5 hrs attempting to get my Xbox app to open my games. I finally took it to my bf who said my Windows wasn’t updated. I updated windows 3x..it refused to complete the update. He ran some kinda cleaner on it to remove corrupted files and finally the games will open. I’m not sure why it was such a hassle to update on a computer I just bought. I have updated several of my old computers with zero problems.If I encounter further issues I am sending it back.,5.0
"For the most part it works. Fan kicks into overdrive if you look at it funny, volume buttons don’t do anything and you need to go into actual settings to increase or decrease. Each time you want to turn it on you have to reboot as it gets stuck on the main screen and doesn’t give you the prompt to put in your pin.",3.0
"I transitioned to this PC from an older Dell PC, and the performance is great by comparison. I am not a fan of Windows 11, but that aside, the software is pretty standard, there wasn't any bloatware that I can recall.

"I was looking for a budget friendly machine to deal with miscellaneous stuff and a moderate amount of intensive gaming.

I'm super satisfied with this purchase and can't recommend it enough for someone looking for a quality laptop that doesn't break the bank.",5.0

The computer works pretty well. I use it for running pretty computationally intensive simulations. I will say that it is extremely loud. It bugs me that I am unable to set the fan speed tables since the one in place is constantly ramping up or down. I could deal with a consistent whir but the fans almost pulsate in speed. Also there is no 3rd party software to control the fans/monitor the system for this computer so your stuck with acers nitrosense which is fault at best. It reads cpu% at 2% while task manager says it’s at 85. CPU temp is 50 degrees then a moment later it’s at 95 without even moving the mouse. I just wish they would fix their software so that the system is more capable.,2.0
"I have three Acer Nitros (i7 / Ryzen 7 / Geforce RTX cards) from prior years' models.  They are amazing laptops that I've been very happy with - they still run great.I ordered the latest 2024 model and the first one must not have had it's heat sync seated correctly because the fan ran an full blast at all times.  It would run hot at 190F when doing basic tasks - in balanced mode with all updates applied.  I returned it.The second laptop I got at least could cool itself, but the fans are ridiculously loud while playing games.  And I'm not one to complain in general.  I ran the same games with the same exact settings/config side-by-side with older Nitro models and the older models were silent (and just as cool) while the newer model was silly loud.You can tell if it's a newer model by looking at the arrow keys - they smashed the arrow keys together and did something weird with the number pad.  Stay away - at least until they do a design refresh.",2.0
Para comenzar no trae BIOS grafica trae una interfaz de BIOS de 1998. no es configurable como se necesita viene para trabajar unica y exclusivamente con el sistema UEFI que no es de mi grado prefiero el LEGACY. el colmo de los colmos es que el software del SO no reconoce ningún micrófono en ninguna aplicación fuera del grabador de sonidos de Windows. motivo por el cual tube que quitarle el W11 Home que traía de fábrica.por todo lo demás esta medianamente decente. mi opinion personal no vale lo que piden y hay mejores opciones por incluso menor costo.,3.0

"Brand new computer, when I turn it on it starts to try and go through the setup, but it says the wifi is turned off and gives me a dropdown to turn it on manually, in 1 hr, in 4 hrs, or 1 day.  I tried selecting both manually and 1hr and left it sitting for over an hour but it hasn't turned on the wifi, and there is no button to turn on wifi, only airplane mode, which if you turn it on the screen says it is on airplane mode, but if you turn it back off, it goes back to saying the wifi is turned off.  I cannot figure out how to get into the boot menu, as one website suggested, because F8, F10, F12, nothing works when trying to boot it and it just goes right back to the start of the setup where you select your region and language.I am going to try again in a couple of hours, but otherwise I am going to demand my money back.

"The fact that you pay for a brand new “gaming laptop” and it has the audacity to just shut off whenever it feels like it and the support team tells you to take it to they’re guys in Texas because there’s something wrong with your brand new laptop runs me the wrong way will never use an Acer again, be warned",1.0

Bought this for Christmas. Immediately started randomly crashing. Amazon customer service said to return it and get money back in 30 days. Not an option. Acer said only solution is to send it away for weeks. What is the point of buying a brand name if they don't hold themselves to any standards?Edit: chose to use Acer support. Got it back a month later with the same issue. DO NOT BUY,1.0
