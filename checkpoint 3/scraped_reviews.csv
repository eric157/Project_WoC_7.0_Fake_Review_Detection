"The Apple iPhone XR is an excellent device with a sleek design, vibrant display, and impressive battery life. The performance is smooth and reliable, making it perfect for everyday use. Overall, it‚Äôs great value for the price, especially for Apple fans",5.0

The reconditioned iPhone XR was in excellent condition and looked like new.  Battery health  is 100%.  I'm very pleased with the condition and value of this phone.,5.0
"I have had this product for a few years and it still runs well enough to keep for now. Please be aware that the ""crack"" seen on the front of the phone was NOT there upon arrival, that is in fact a slightly cracked screen cover I installed personally after purchasing.The Apple iPhone XR, 64GB, Black (Renewed) is an excellent choice for those looking to get a high-quality iPhone without breaking the bank. As a renewed product, it offers great functionality and performance, making it a worthwhile investment.Performance and Quality:The iPhone XR performs impressively well. The A12 Bionic chip ensures smooth operation, and the battery life is commendable. The 6.1-inch Liquid Retina display is vibrant and clear, making it perfect for media consumption and everyday use. Despite being a renewed product, it functions just as efficiently as a brand-new phone.Value for Money:At this price point, the iPhone XR is a fantastic deal. You get all the features and capabilities of an iPhone without the premium price tag of a brand-new model. For those on a budget, this unlocked version provides flexibility and the freedom to choose your carrier.Condition:However, it‚Äôs important to note that the phone does come with some visible wear and tear. While these cosmetic imperfections do not affect the device's performance, they are noticeable. For instance, there might be minor scratches or scuffs on the screen and body. This is expected with a renewed product, but it‚Äôs something potential buyers should be aware of.Overall:Overall, the Apple iPhone XR, 64GB, Black (Unlocked) (Renewed) is a solid purchase. It delivers high performance and quality at a reduced cost, making it an excellent value. While it‚Äôs not perfect due to visible wear and tear, it‚Äôs a small trade-off for the significant savings and the ability to own a high-functioning iPhone. I would definitely recommend it for anyone looking to get the most out of their money.",4.0
I was skeptical purchasing a refurbished phone but it looks new. Works great and my daughter loves the colors!,5.0
This phone came spanking brand new no crack no scratches nothing at all this is amazing I love this iPhone 10/10 definitely would recommend amazing thank you so much,5.0
"The exterior is in perfect condition and so far it‚Äôs operating like my previous one iPhone XR. I had accidentally ordered the one that was only 2g (which no one should want) and the seller responded and my cancellation was approved and I got the phone a day earlier. This phone has 4g.The battery: I tested this one. I got 8.2 hours from 100% to 3% with it in Low Mode purposely doing battery-sucking things such as downloading all my apps while a long update was happening, watching videos, syncing stuff from iCloud such as photos, playing a game, etc. The phone was a bit warm and working hard. They guarantee that it will be at least at 80% capacity and some people are lucky to get more. Mine came at 79% which is not a big deal and I just can‚Äôt be without a phone.80% isn‚Äôt terrible unless you constantly are doing battery sucking things. Don‚Äôt fret. My previous one was four or five years old and was at 80% before it got destroyed. They say you lose 1% a month. Not mine because I did battery saving things. At home I would plug it in since I watch battery-sucking things like long YT videos. Often I keep it in low mode and the screen turns off quickly-I have to put in my Lock Screen password a lot which is annoying but it saves usage. When I charge it I practically turn off the light. Turn off background refresh on apps that aren‚Äôt that important to be refreshed. Keep your screen brightness as dim as you can handle. I think using it in airplane mode helps. I keep location services off until an app needs it. If you put it on Never so you don‚Äôt have to keep tapping the screen, that seriously sucks up the battery. If you take lots of photos and videos, say on vacation, you might want to bring an external battery charger. Limit your notifications on your Lock Screen because all that lighting up sucks your battery. Look at your battery health to see what you‚Äôre doing.80% isn‚Äôt bad. It depends what you do on it and how you set your screen.",5.0
"The phone I received was by all estimations brand new. Not a mark on it and fully charged. However, being new to the Apple World, I can honestly say Windows & Android are both in plain, simple, super easy to understand English. Apple is not. Even its keyboard is not a full Standard Keyboard, like it is with Windows & any Google machine. Android is Google, that's why I say it that way. No getting around it. Just keeping it short & to the point. Apple's iPhone keyboard takes extreme amount of effort to use because it is not the Standard keyboard of every other operating system. Thankfully, I was able to connect a Bluetooth keyboard to it. Otherwise, it's a serious no-go for keyboard use.As for Apple's iPhone Touchscreen, again, I find it sorely lacking. There's no such thing as the simple pinch & zoom on it. That particular luxury seems to be found only within the Camera & Picture sections. You'd think it'd at least be within the iBook section but it's not. On most everything Windows or Google, every app is not just touch & activate, but also affords the luxury of pinch & zoom as well as easy swipe & easy app close & dismiss. Can't say that about the Apple iPhone.And for some unknown reason its WiFi also keeps turning itself on. I can't seem to keep it off no matter how often I manually turn it off.For Apple being so USER-FRIENDLY, I cannot at all say that it is. In fact, IT IS ANYTHING BUT USER-FRIENDLY.  If the Apple World was so user-friendly, then it would be a very simple and easy transition from the Windows or Google platform to Apple. And I can honestly say it is Not at all simple or easy. I was so hoping it would be as simple & easy as my Windows machine & Android phone, but sadly, it's actually quite maddening.If you enjoy Kindle reads, you'll need to install the app for it. But I can also tell you, Apple's iBook seriously pales in comparison to Kindle. Ironically, the Google Search Engine is installed on Apple's iPhone but Kindle is not. I avoid Google anything & everything as much as can be done. But for Apple to deny Amazon's Kindle Apple on its phones, seems almost a crime.I have yet to install the Kindle reading app or to test out the camera on the iPhone. When I do I'll update my review. But currently I can't say it's anything to brag about. And I most certainly did not expect to see Google's Search Engine/Web Browser on it.Size wise, it's the exact same size as my Sony Xperia Z3v. It still functions quite well. Not perfect, but well enough for me since I have it locked to call, text, Kindle reads & camera.  I can easily read, pinch & zoom & highlight my Kindle reads, pictures & text messages on it. Can only do that with pictures on the iPhone. So for it being so great, I actually find it quite limiting. Not because it's an iPhone, but because the Apple creators decided to create a platform that is quite complex and extremely arduous to use. Apple created its own ""language"" that must be learned in order to navigate the complexities of its Eco-system.  Even now, trying to login to the Apple App Store, no keyboard appears so I can actually install Apps necessary for my personal use. Yet you're required to sign in to it. How can you sign into the App Store when NO KEYBOARD APPEARS TO LET YOU?! So, even if I did not want to use the phone feature, but instead use it as a computer tablet, I cannot because it won't let me login to the App Store. ... Like I said, to anyone new to the Apple world, it's quite a infuriatingly maddening conundrum. If Apple wants to gain new customers and retain them, then Apple needs to change how it operates. And if Apple is supposed to be the safest of all online platforms, then it should not sport Google's web browser.The phone I received was/is like brand new. Operating it though, takes considerable patients as it is quite the learning curve. It should not be so difficult to transition from Windows, Android or Google to Apple. They all made sense to everybody from the moment they came out because they were in simple English and easily understood and simple to navigate because of it. Apple on the other hand, not by a long shot. Even Apple's touchscreen capabilities sorely lacks in comparison. And that's sad. You'd think their touchscreen capabilities would be at least on-par with Windows, Google & Android but it is not. You'd think Apple's touchscreen capabilities might even be better than Windows, Android & Google, but no. Thus far I can find nothing to brag about regarding Apple anything. I was so hoping to find something better about Apple. Instead, I'm greatly disappointed and left seriously frustrated.The iPhone itself came fully charged and appears in brand new condition. It also came with an original Apple Charger.I give the seller a stellar 5 star rating, along with the iPhone I received.I give Apple itself a mediocre 3, even 2 star rating.So to anyone new to the Apple world, maybe an iPad would be easier to use. I started with a phone since I need both a new phone & a new computer and figured Apple would be a serious upgrade to Windows and for sure compared to Google's Android. ... Apple is not at all user-friendly to a first time user. Only Windows, Google & Android can actually claim user-friendly bragging rights, from day one for any first time user.Apparently I need either direct Apple support or YouTube's Apple education in order to learn how to make the best use of this phone.  I don't fault the phone for anything. It's an Apple thing. It's very nearly like you gotta go to MIT to learn it. And that's just not right.Will update as I learn how to navigate Apple's world & extremely clunky Eco-system.1st Time Apple iPhone User Assessment. -Phone - good. - can't give it high marks due to Apple itself.Apple - not worth all the money & certainly nothing to brag about.",4.0
"I needed to replace my iPhone, chose a renewed iPhone XR.  It arrived in 2 days and looked perfect - no scratches on screen, battery max capacity at 96%.  At the last step of transitioning from old phone, when I went to put my Verizon SIM card in SIM tray  there was no SIM tray, just an opening for it. The seller wanted a photo as documentation - crazy since that proves nothing, I could have just taken it out!  but I sent photo and they sent a replacement SIM tray.**Hopefully helpful note, to save someone else from trouble I faced: When I took SIM out of old phone but needed SIM tray on new phone to insert, the removal of my SIM without immediate reinstallation triggered Verizon to suspend my phone number for potential SIM fraud.  I spent 1 hour online chat with Verizon rep who was unable to get restriction removed, then advised to go to local Verizon office and I spent 2 hours (no exaggeration) getting my phone number back. Apparently SIM stealing is a new thing and with two-factor authentication the carriers are taking risk super seriously.  Moral of story: check your new phone to be sure it has a SIM tray before you switch over!Overall, except for SIM tray issue - seller was good and renewed phone seems great so far!",4.0
"So far so good. I have only had this phone for a day. It arrived a day early. It was clean both inside and out, and you couldn't really tell that this wasn't a brand new phone. The XR has most all the features that anyone would need or actually use (who needs a 3d camera really) and it gets a perfectly clean signal and sound. All I had to do was put in my SIM card, my zip cade and log into iCloud. For the money, if this lasts a year or two it will have been worth every dime.It was missing the charger, but they agreed to send on right away, so that wasn't a problem.",5.0
"I was apprehensive about getting a refurbished phone, however I must say there have been no issues with it and it was in almost perfect aesthetic condition when I received it. I will buy another certified refurbished phone when the time comes but there is nothing wrong with this one.",5.0
I‚Äôm not one of those need the newest iPhone people I just want whatever phone I have to work and this one does just that. I was impressed at how clean it is considering it‚Äôs refurbished‚Ä¶ you would never know unless I were to say something. Super happy and the price was a great selling point as well!,5.0

"Honestly I was afraid to buy a refurbished phone, but after getting it I wasn‚Äôt disappointed. I‚Äôve been using it for over a year and a half and it‚Äôs still working good",4.0
"Initially it was fine while unboxing.The camera lens was chipped, and there was noticeable wear on backside of phone.Once it was charged and the phone transfer process was started it functioned.Then midway into transfer the screen went blank and it wouldn‚Äôt detect anything on touch screen. The transfer process had to be paused and the phone had to be reset to function again. After resetting the transfer process completed. I put it in a special case and of course installed a tempered glass screen protector.The next day while attempting to use the phone the screen went blank and wouldn‚Äôt initialize or detect touch and the phone could not be used.Again it had to be reset and restarted so the screen initialization and touch detection would start working again.It did not come as it was described in the original description. This was my first renewed experience and purchase of an Apple phone on Amazon. I am disappointed and I expected better. I expected a normally functioning phone without problem and reliability issues.",3.0

"This is my first I-phone purchase, previously having used only android phones.  The phone arrived in very good to excellent condition.  The screen and body were in excellent condition.  A tiny amount of prior use was evident at the point where the charger connected to the phone.  The phone was charged and ready for use.  Following the prompts on the phone, I was able to transfer my contacts from my android phone to the I-phone over WiFi with no problems.  Due to my arthritic hands,  I had difficulty inserting the SIM card, but a quick trip to a nearby Apple Store solved that issue. I will purchase a refurbished phone in the future when the need arises.  Also, the phone arrived overnight.",5.0

"Seller I Give 5 Stars For Promised Shipping & Packaging & Accepting The Phone Back Even A few days past the 90 Day Return Policy. The phone was in Very Good Cosmetic Condition. Also had a screen Protector on this phone. Also The Transfer off Ny iPhone 7 to The iPhone XR was Quick & Easy.I wanted to like the iphone RX But For Me I like the smaller iPhone feel For Better Handling for My small hands.Also, My phone usage is a few lengthy calls per day & google or FB Market Place Searching & once in a while I open My email.The iPhone had Several issues Right Out The Box:I had to connect the phone to charge at least 4 times each day.Charge did not last for even a lengthy Phone call.Also, The Speaker was muffled I had to keep the volume medium to low to avoid the blasting muffled sound of receiver speaker.I also many times would click over & over on a link or to edit or go to next page etc & often after several attempts just give up. Maybe the touch sensitivity or Screen Protector.But also weird was clicking sometimes & go silent in same text or search while I was typing.I like that I have the option to try a refurbished iPhone at reasonable price & if it doesn‚Äôt work out May return up to 90 days after receiving.I did find and purchase another smaller iPhone refurbished from another seller here on Amazon.I Appreciate Amazon & The Sellers For Their Customer Service & Products Available for Purchase.",4.0

"Everything on the outside seems perfect despite some slight scuffs along the edges of the phone that a phone case easily covers and micro scratches on the screen that you don‚Äôt see unless the screens off and you hold it up at different angles.My main concern has to do with the battery Amazon had installed into the phone, as soon as I set my phone up, I got an alert claiming the batter may be in-authentic and in-turn, will affect my phones full capabilities.The only reason I‚Äôm being generous on my rating is because I think the issue has more to do with Amazon than the seller.Amazon is sending me a new phone and I‚Äôll be updating my review as soon as I get the new one in the mail about 12-15 days .Update:The only good news  I have to report is that the phone arrived sooner than the 12-15 days they said it would take‚Ä¶The bad news is, the replacement I received was in worse condition than first‚Ä¶The second phone arrived to me and the first thing I noticed was the front speaker and filthy it was. There was so much dirt and crud caked into it, that it was stark white .. I could just tell by looking at it, that it was going to effect the sound quality which it definitely did (I even tried cleaning it but it was cemented in there). I started  to wonder if they even inspected the phone at all because they claim to clean their phone‚Äôs  thoroughly so if they didn‚Äôt even notice that, and then I went to turn the phone on, the battery was already completely dead which is already a bad sign because you‚Äôre expecting a ‚Äúrenewed‚Äù phone to have all new parts meaning it should have been almost fully charged ‚Ä¶ so if the replacement phones battery was completely drained, how would they have looked at it to even inspect it unless something was wrong with the battery that caused the phone to drain while it was shut off but then that circles back to the inspectors again and them not properly doing their job. if the battery was faulty, they should have caught it and fixed the issue before sending it out‚Ä¶once the phone got a charge, I did notice that  I wasn‚Äôt getting any alerts about the battery being in-authentic like the first phone did so I believe the 2nd phone still has all its original parts but then it shouldn‚Äôt be considered renewed‚Ä¶  the phone also took a really long time to charge and as I mentioned, the sound quality was horrid.I just hate this cat and mouse game of having to send phones back and forth and having to reset them and transfer all my date over and over again so I just decided to suck it up and keep the first iPhone I got and pray it works out because I‚Äôve read stories of Apple locking users out of their phones if it‚Äôs believed their phones have in-authentic parts including batteries. I‚Äôll try to remember to give anyone who wants to know, an update in a month or so.Update 02/26/23-Phone still works and I haven‚Äôt had any major issues expect the the battery life doesn‚Äôt hold a charge for long and the camera quality is horrid. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll be getting an iPhone ever again. Android is way better in my opinion .",3.0

"Got this phone for my dad because he needed a new one. It worked well at first with some things that wouldn‚Äôt work occasionally but that‚Äôs to be expected with an older model iPhone.About 8 months in it started deteriorating pretty quickly starting with the storage. It got to the point that he couldn‚Äôt take any pictures because he doesn‚Äôt have enough available memory despite him clearing out nearly all of his texts (which is what was said to be taking up so much) and he has 9 apps that he downloaded. He‚Äôs supposed to have 64 gb yet every day it says he‚Äôs out.Now his phone is hardly usable. Siri and any voice operations work about 30% of the time. The phone often won‚Äôt wring when he receives a call and when he‚Äôs trying to do stuff on it, it‚Äôs unresponsive a lot and occasionally bugs out and freezes. It‚Äôs now at the point where we have to get him a new phone‚Ä¶ one year later",3.0

The phone only had a super small dent on the circular part of the camera, and was only noticeable if you really examined the phone. The phone looked perfect besides that. The phone does overheat easily now sadly and freeze somewhat frequently, but during the first year it was honestly not happening. The phone gets worse the longer you have it obviously but I guess you can‚Äôt expect a renewed phone to last for a long time and I don‚Äôt regret buying this :)",4.0
"This is my first phone purchase in almost a decade. I am going from an iPhone 5s to an iPhone XR.I asked someone for advice for where to purchase my next iPhone. I have a lack of trust when it comes to purchasing phones on the internet after hearing about so many stories of people being scammed. I was told by a couple of people that amazon has registered users so I gave it a try.So far I am happy with my purchase. The iPhone is in like new condition with no major scratches. However, there are two little scratch indentations on the front screen. They are hardly noticeable because they are to the side of the front just off the LCD screen and screen protector and do not interfere with the use of the phone.When it comes to the actual phone itself, the big screen, sound quality, and fast processor are something to smile about. Apple outdid themselves with this phone. The only thing that will take some getting use to is the big slim design. I find it hard to reach some parts of the screen while holding the phone in one hand. I think there is an adjustment period. The phone was incredibly easy to set-up. I just had to back my old iPhone up to iTunes and then restore that backup on the XR.I do not like how there is no headphone jack and that the phone only has 64g storage but this can be overlooked. (I know that I also have the option of purchasing a different model that has better storage and a headphone jack I just thought it is worth mentioning for anyone considering to buy this item.)Pros-Great price. Fast shipping time. Sold from someone trustworthy. Honest listing and as described. Came with screen protector and SIM removal tool. The phone indicates that the battery life is at 95%.As a phone, great quality overall. The LCD screen is big and bright. The sound is fantastic. The processor is super fast (I think one of the fastest processors you can purchase in a smartphone).Cons-The phone came with a knockoff charger not an OEM (original) Apple charger or headphones. Yes, using an Apple charger versus using a knock off makes a difference, look into it if you do not believe me. Fortunately I have my old Apple chargers. The screen has a couple miner indented scratches. My finger covers the mic at the bottom of the phone sometimes when I record videos. The audio gets blocked or becomes scratchy.I made this review as detailed as possible because I greatly benefited from other reviews made by other people that purchased this phone.One major takeaway from all of the comments on this listing is to be careful that you may or may not get a phone that has some sort of issue. I think this comes with the territory when it comes to purchasing a renewed phone. When you are spending a lot of money on a phone you expect quality and consistency. For a couple of hundred dollars more I could have bought straight from Apple, but I am happy I got to save that money.",4.0
"This product works very well and I am happy with it thus far. I'd much rather buy a used phone than pay a ridiculous prices for a newer iPhone. I bought another user iPhone through Amazon and they both work well. If you can get past the fact that someone has used it before, it's worth considering.",4.0
"The fact that it‚Äôs unlocked means it works with a variety of carriers, which is a big plus. However, I‚Äôve noticed that the phone can be a little slow at times. While it handles basic tasks like texting and calling with no issues, I‚Äôve experienced some lag when switching between apps or when multitasking. It‚Äôs not terrible, but it can be a little annoying, especially if you‚Äôre used to newer models. The battery life is decent, though I found myself charging it more frequently than expected.",3.0

"I‚Äôve been an Android user since the beginning but finally decided to switch to Apple based on recent and upcoming Google changes.Very happy with this iPhone XR! I chose this model because it was new enough while not being too heavy an investment.  I was using a MotoZ and this XR is equal in size and efficiency. I also used a Samsung Note10 and this is a bit smaller.  The size fits nicely into my small purse and pockets. I chose the 256GB because I know having a faster phone with more storage matters. Nothing worse than a sluggish device.The face recognition works great and is much handier than using my fingerprint. I haven‚Äôt had any issues logging in regardless of how my hair is styled and whether I‚Äôm wearing glasses or not.I love the color! It‚Äôs more of an orange than red. The camera is faaar better than any of my previous phones, except for the Sony I once owned.This model came with the power cord, power plug, and ear pods making it ready to go straight out of the box. Just needed to give it a good charge before using.Buying refurbished devises has been something I‚Äôve had only success with. I‚Äôm always careful and do my research on the seller before buying. Plus I invest in the extended warranty through Amazon plus in this case I chose Apple Care. Money is always a huge issue for me but in this case I won‚Äôt buy without the added protection. Phones are too essential not to.Learning the Apple layout and differences has been new but not a struggle. I find the biggest issue is the power button is on the opposite side of the device. For things I haven‚Äôt known how to do I‚Äôve used Apple.com and searched Google.It‚Äôs impossible to get away from Google completely but at least I know my info is safe now.I would totally recommend this seller and product to friends and family!",5.0
"This seller had wonderful reviews and that is the ONLY reason I bought my phone from them.

Ordered a replacement today from them again and I know it will be in great condition.  Loved the phone, just had a glitch that probably happened during transit.

I opted for more memory and sharing my iCloud allocation to off board photos and videos so it works well with games.  Apple still supports and you can search online for which products phase out Apple support and when.  This was not inexpensive but a good value for my requirements. And the little guy learns responsibility and conversations about safety online.",5.0
"Brought dis back in Jan. and I still haven‚Äôt switched everything over from my 7plus yet lmao. I changed my mind to go ahead and get an iPhone without a home button. I‚Äôve gotten real adjusted to everything and fell in love. Tha special updates etc dat comes with it and that‚Äôs on it makes my day forreal. I do plan to upgrade again to prolly like a 13 or 14. I want one even bigger. Ik ts EXPANSIVEü§£but Lord‚Äôs willing, I can find one that‚Äôs brand spanking new , hella storage space, and fits my budget.  :)",5.0
"I was a bit nervous getting renewed but I'm on a budget and I had to buy this plus the Apple Watch 6 for health tracking purposes. There is absolutely no scuffs, dings, or scratches. The only way you can tell it is renewed was battery life was about 89% Which isn't horrible. It still lasts me the day and as this isn't brand new, I'm not dinging a star for that. (Plus I believe that is better than advertised)This along with the watch were my first ever Apple products. I previously had a Moto Stylus and a Samsung Galaxy Active 2 Watch. I wanted a watch that would alert me when I had an Afib episode, which the samsung didn't. A lot of afib patients suggest Apple watch for this, which meant I needed an Apple phone.The battery, even new, I don't think would have outperformed my Moto but that's a thing Moto is kinda known for is their big batteries. But as mentioned before, it lasts me all day.I LOVE the blue color. I bought a rugged clear case from local store so that I could protect it while still being able to see the pretty color.Had zero problems putting Mint Mobile on it, so unlocked as promised. Never used an esim before so that was really neat.The apps are amazing and far more varied than Android. That night time wind down is no joke, but I like it. It really is great at making sure I don't pick up my phone and just mess around after bed time and I like that it gives me a little warning so I can go read or do something to wind down for bed.Display is clear and nice.Performance is snappy. A little sad there's not a headphone jack but that's pretty typical these days. Just nice to have something for when your earbuds run out of juice. But it synced upOverall, I know this phone is a bit older in 2022 but I honestly feel like it's almost better than some of the flagship Android phones that are new at a lower price. Overall, I'm really happy. It's really helped become a health tracker as much as a phone. I'm getting why people like Apple now and will probably buy more apple products in the future.",5.0

"Shipping took a while, and battery health was at 82% so not exactly ""renewed"". I'm going to keep it because I don't want to go thru the hassle of a return and re-ordering something else. But I would not buy from this vendor.",3.0

"I purchased the unlocked iPhone XR 64GB unlocked renewed premium. I was pleasantly surprised when it arrived. The outside of the phone is flawless, it looks brand new. The battery is 96% of original capacity and it operates without issue. Only problem was a shipping delay, but the seller promptly refunded the extra I paid for expedited shipping. Overall a great experience and great seller. I highly recommend.",5.0
"I really like this iPhone, not too big and not too small. Everything looks great and I sent back the IPhone 12 Pro. I didn‚Äôt even need to open the box it came in. UPS picked it up at my front door the next day. Also the iPhone  XR has a 92 % battery, not bad.",4.0

"My husband has been using an iPhone 6 for years. He‚Äôs not one to really care about the new phones or anything, but the storage and battery life of his old phone was horrible. He‚Äôs been talking about getting a new one, so I purchased this one. He‚Äôs in love with it! The battery is so much better. Camera quality is perfect. He says sometimes it doesn‚Äôt recognize his face but that‚Äôs it. The phone you can tell was used. The screen protector has a scratch but easily replaced and fixed. The back camera lining has some scratches but other than that it looks brand new. Looks and works perfect. For the price I‚Äôm happy, and he is too. The speed is much better and he enjoys having a larger screen to play his games on lol. Thank you!",5.0
The media could not be loaded.Very much impressed with the phone. It‚Äôs very clean and looking like a new phone. It‚Äôs unlocked and able to use it right away with a SIM card.I requested the seller for the IMEI number when the phone was on the way. I got a quick response back with the info. I was able to verify the carrier compatibility even before the phone was arrived.,5.0
"I purchased this phone with the intent of having it for a very short period of time.  My plan was to use it as a trade-in since my previous phone was too old to qualify (iPhone 6 Plus).  I purchased the phone for around $250 and got an $800 trade-in value on an iPhone 14 Pro Max, when switching from one carrier to another.  I'd been with the previous carrier for 20 some years but it was time for a change.The only thing that kept me from giving this 5 stars, is that it had non-Apple parts on it that the new carrier was somehow able to identify, maybe battery, maybe screen?  Perhaps there is some history somewhere of previous iPhone repairs.  Anyway, the replacement parts were determined to be acceptable and the $800 credit was given.  I ended up using the phone for a couple of weeks while waiting for my new phone to come in.  The phone functioned to my satisfaction.I didn't rate the face recognition because after two attempts, I did not get it to work.  My wife said I wasn't doing it right and that may be the case.  I was trying to follow the camera with my eyes when moving the phone around in the circle.  The app completed, be then said I was unable to use face recognition.  The front camera did work, so again, perhaps the failure was unrelated to the phone.For anyone who wants to try to save a few hundred dollars on trading in a phone, this may be the way to go.  As I found out though, there could potentially be some risk depending on the parts used for any repairs made.",4.0
This phone was basically brand new in my eyes! If it was pre owned I couldn‚Äôt tell. Not a single scuff. The coral color is absolutely amazing! Battery health was 78% but it still lasts me the entire day and into the next. I recommend.,5.0
